## Hello everyone!!! :information_desk_person:

My name is Phuong (Sam) Can, a Master's student in Quantitative Psychology. I'm from Vietnam where you can find beautiful beaches :ocean:, probably less rain :umbrella: and plenty of sun :sunny:. 

Now a bit about my philosophical side. My career interests are quantitative methodologies but my life interest is life-long learning, which encompasses gaining knowledge and intuition in a wide variety of topics, hence building a sense of wisdom :older_man::older_woman:. As B. F. Skinner has put it:

> "Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten."

Besides this big abstract interest, I do have concrete hobbies:
- [ ] play the piano
- [ ] eat Ramen
- [ ] food travel
- [ ] read about interior design
- [ ] think about the abstracts... 

That's it about me. Thanks for visiting my page!!!
